# Food Redistribution Network

## Overview
The **Food Redistribution Network** is a purpose-driven platform designed to combat food waste by connecting food suppliers, food banks, and non-profit organizations. By ensuring surplus food reaches those in need, we aim to create a sustainable and equitable food distribution system.

## How It Works
- üè≠ **From Suppliers**: Excess food from restaurants, grocery stores, and events is listed on the platform.
- üè° **To Non-Profits**: Food banks and non-profits are notified and can claim available resources in real time.
- üîÑ **Smart Logistics**: Optimized for quick, efficient, and local redistribution to minimize waste and maximize impact.

## Mission
Our mission is to ensure that no good food goes to waste while addressing hunger and food insecurity. Together, we can build a network where surplus meets need, creating a better tomorrow for all.

## Applications
This technology is ideal for:
- **Food Banks**: Connecting them with a steady supply of surplus food.
- **Restaurants & Grocery Stores**: Reducing waste while contributing to the community.
- **Non-Profit Organizations**: Accessing food resources to serve those in need.
